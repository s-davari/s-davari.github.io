    <meta name="description" content="I’m Shakiba, a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the 3D Interaction Group at Virginia Tech under the supervision of Doug Bowman. Intelligent Augmented Reality (AR) Interface Design: My research interest lies in connecting my past research experience in applied machine learning (ML) and my current passion for AR interface design. I am a 3D interaction/interface designer, focusing on intelligent AR interfaces. I concentrate on different aspects of detecting AR user’s context and utilizing it to adapt their AR interface. Such context-aware interfaces mitigate the existing challenges of AR, such as real-world occlusion and social intrusiveness, while providing more reliable and efficient information access and interaction in AR."/>

          I am a Ph.D. student with research focusing on creating code analysis tools to assist developers by identifying cryptographic misuse in software repositories.
	My tools save developers time by using on-demand static code analysis to specifically scan for the cryptographic rules that may be broken.
	My tools also show higher precision than existing tools to ensure developers pay attention to the results.
	I also utilize several formats for my results to fit into many different DevOps tools and fit nicely into the development lifecycle.
	<br>
	<br>
    Focusing on the source of the vulnerabilities will provide better long-term solutions as opposed to continuing patching the issues.
    My application-focused research allows me to provide direct impact to current and upcoming vulnerabilities.
	{#
        I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. Computer Science student and am currently working on exciting projects.
        Currently, I am working with <a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/danfeng/">Dr. Danfeng Yao</a>.
        <br>
        Previously I have worked in <a href="https://worldpay.com/">Worldpay from FIS</a> for several Internships (or Co-Ops) and have learned a lot through my various teams.

        I enjoy working on side projects to help developers secure their code.

            Automatic screening of cryptographic misuse vulnerabilities has
            been a popular and important line of research over the years. How-
            ever, the vision of producing a scalable detection tool that devel-
            opers can routinely use to screen millions of line of code has not
            been achieved yet.
            Our main technical goal is to attain a high precision and high
            throughput approach based on specialized program analysis. Specifi-
            cally, we design inter-procedural program slicing on top of a new on-
            demand flow-, context- and field- sensitive data flow analysis. Our
            current prototype named CryptoGuard can detect a wide range of
            Java cryptographic API misuses with a precision of 98.61%, when
            evaluated on 46 complex Apache Software Foundation projects
            (including, Spark, Ranger, and Ofbiz). Our evaluation on 6,181 An-
            droid apps also generated many security insights. We created a
            comprehensive benchmark named CryptoApi-Bench with 40-unit
            basic cases and 131-unit advanced cases for in-depth comparison
            with leading solutions (e.g., SpotBugs, CrySL, Coverity). To make
            CryptoGuard widely accessible, we are in the process of inte-
            grating CryptoGuard with the Software Assurance Marketplace
            (SWAMP). SWAMP is a popular no-cost service for continuous soft-
            ware assurance and static code analysis.</q></blockquote>",color="yellow")|safe

      Since I use a various set of tools for different development and research environments, I needed to be able to easily switch my toolsets. Due to hard-drive space limitations, I started to leverage Docker. I used my familiarity with GitHub actions to create a chain creation of several Docker Images. The Scripts and PyScripts are both Python script repositories creating inbuilt scripts. BaseDocker is the first Docker Image that builds, and each subsequent Docker image builds off of it. For example, JavaDev is built off of BaseDocker using a script from PyScript to automatically download and include several packages.
      <br><br>
      Why did I do this? Simply to create an inheritence based environment tool chain. If I need a common utility between two docker images, I just include it in BaseDocker and the changes will trickle down. Many of these are private simply due to various custom builds processes I use.
